					<p>You will be assigned 3 unique passwords, one for your email, banking and shopping.
					For each password, you will be presented with 
					7 unique sets of words total, each composing of 8 words, and you will be assigned to select one of them.
					Which words you select from each set will be your password. The order of the sets and which
					words on the sets appear will remain the same each time. This scheme aims to take advantage of your
					ability to recognize familiar words.</p>
