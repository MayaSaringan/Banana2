 This designs the website that hosts our password scheme and the framework to test it.
 Every step in our framework occurs in a single webpage, but are separated into different
 div elements that are hidden until the user has progressed to a certain point in testing our
 password scheme. All of the steps occur in a single page to ensure that the user goes 
 through the pages in the order desired and cannot cut through to the middle of the
 test by visiting a different page.
 
 The elements are dynamically hidden and shown with the aid of jquery and javascript, the code for which
 is in script.js. This script also handles creation of passwords and handles events that walks the user
 through the testing process

					<p>You will be assigned 3 unique passwords, one for your email, banking and shopping.
					For each password, you will be presented with 
					7 unique sets of words total, each composing of 8 words, and you will be assigned to select one of them.
					Which words you select from each set will be your password. The order of the sets and which
					words on the sets appear will remain the same each time. This scheme aims to take advantage of your
					ability to recognize familiar words.</p>
